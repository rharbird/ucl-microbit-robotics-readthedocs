Micro:bit - Getting Started
****************************

The BBC micro:bit is a tiny computer that you can use to create all kinds of projects from robots to musical instruments –
the possibilities are endless. There are a myriad of features that you can use in your designs:

 * 25 red LED lights that can flash messages.
 * Two programmable buttons (A and B) that can be used to tell the micro:bit when to start and stop things.
 * A thermistor to measure the temperature.
 * A light sensor to measure the change in light.
 * An accelerometer to detect motion.
 * A magnetometer to tell you which direction you’re heading in.
 * A radio and a Bluetooth Low Energy connection to interact with other devices.

Let's create your first micro:bit program; after that, well we've listed a few ideas but it's really up to you.

===================
Your First Program
===================
Coding using the micro:bit is composed of these 4 steps. You can expect to go around the loop  quite a few times before you get your code working.

Design the Code
----------------

First of all you are going to write a program to display the message “Hello UCL!” followed by an image on the display of your micro:bit. There's not much planning and design to do here, but just so that you understand what a plan might look like:

Write the Code
--------------

We will be programming the micro:bit using Microsoft's makecode programming environment with some added software to drive the motors. To start coding, open a browser, and go to this URL: `https://goo.gl/nKmyrn <https://makecode.microbit.org/_85wKMW2KM0u1>`_. When you see the screen below, press the ``Edit`` button.

*Microsoft makecode*

You should see a screen like the one below and you are now ready to make the micro:bit, and eventally your robot, do something.

We will use a special text editor to write our programs, it looks like the one shown here:

Let's go through this line-by-line::

	while True:

This means do something (whatever follows this statement and is indented) forever and ever and ever. This is called  a loop, it's a bit like a video clip that's stuck on repeat.  ``True`` and ``False`` have a special meaning in python. ``True`` is always, well ``True``. The rest of the program is straightforward::

	from microbit import *

	while True:
    	    display.show('Hello UCL!')
            display.show(Image.BUTTERFLY)
	    print('Hi There!!!')
    	    sleep(2000)

This displays ``Hello UCL`` on the LED display one character at a time and then shows the butterfly.
The statement ``print('Hi There!!')``, will print the message in the REPL. Press the REPL button in the menu now to show the REPL window:

The REPL window shows us messages from the micro:bit and also allows us to send commands directly to the micro:bit. For now, we'll just be using the REPL to see messages that we print and error messages.

You might be wondering why we've asked the
micro:bit to sleep for ``2000``! This value is in microseconds so we've really only asked it to sleep for 2 seconds. That will give us enough time to see the image before the micro:bit starts all over again.


Upload the Code
----------------
Final checks. Is your micro:bit connected to your computer? Yes? Then press the flash button:

You should see the message and the image displayed on the micro:bit and the message "Hello There!!" should be printed on the REPL.

Make a change
-------------
Change the text that is displayed on the screen and make it scroll across the LED display. You can do this by changing the word ``show`` to ``scroll``. Don't forget to save your program and remember to  ``flash`` the new code to the micro:bit.

You have written your first program. Carry on and see what else you can do with the micro:bit.
