Servo Motors
************************
Let's begin by taking a look at the servo motor. There are two types of
servo – the first type is one where you can choose an angle to which the arms should
rotate; the second goes round and round at a speed you set. We’re going to use
the first type.

Servos are used all over the place in both daily life and in robotics. A servo
might retract the tray of a DVD player or might be used in radio controlled
vehicles and aeroplanes to control the rudder of a boat, or the ailerons on a
plane.
