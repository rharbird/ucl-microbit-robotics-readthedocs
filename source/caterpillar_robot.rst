Caterpillar Robot

Aims
----
We’re going to build a crawling robot that’s inspired by some types of caterpillar.
The first thing we should do is to take a look at how a caterpillar moves? Take a
look at these YouTube clips:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9Km0edRFG4

The robot we are going to build will only have 3 body segments but, as you can
see from the video, a wave passes along the caterpillar so we’ll try to mimic that.

For this project, we’re going to need some power to move the caterpillar snd we
will use a motor, called a servo motor to provide this. We'll control the motors
using a program written on a micro:bit.
