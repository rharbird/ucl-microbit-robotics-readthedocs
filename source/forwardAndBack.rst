Well done, you have got the motor moving and you can see that it moves from 0째 to 180째 as you press the button. Now we need to change the code so that the motor moves without human intervention so that our caterpillar can crawl.

-----------------------
New code
-----------------------
We are going to move some of the code around using these steps.

Step 1:
^^^^^^
Any code that you put in the ``forever`` loop will keep repeating over and over as its name suggests. Move the code in the ``on button A pressed`` loop to the ``forever`` loop. Delete the ``on button A pressed`` loop. Your code should now look like this:

Step 2:
^^^^^^
Now add a pause of 20 milliseconds at the end of the ``forever`` loop to give the motor a chance to move in response to the command from the micro:bit. You can see that we have added an extra pause of 180ms. This is because it will take the motor about 180 milliseconds to travel back from 180째 to 0째.

Step 3:
^^^^^^
Try the program out. Upload your code to the micro:bit. Did it work? Keep experimenting until you are satisfied with the outcome.
