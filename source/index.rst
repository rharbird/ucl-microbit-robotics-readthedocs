UCL's Micro:bit Robotics
========================

These projects are designed to give students an introduction to robots which are inspired by the natural world. There's no need to know how to code before diving in but we can assure you that, once you have, you won't want to stop.

The first project is a Caterpillar created from 3D printed parts and servo motors with the micro:bit driving the motors to create a crawling motion. It's a real challenge and students will enjoy finding out how to make the fastest, most effective robot.

Teaching students to code by using a microprocessor and embedded sensors on the board, is an approach inspired by Prof. Stephen Hailes at UCL. His team designed the Engduino, an Arduino board with sensors which was a forerunner of the BBC Micro:bit.
