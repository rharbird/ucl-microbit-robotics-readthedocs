Moving motors

-----------------
Set up the motors
-----------------
Click on the ``ServoBoard`` menu so that you can see the blocks.

Now drag out the blocks that will set up the motors and place them in the ``on start`` jaws so that your code looks like this:

Make the motors move
--------------------
Now we will add some code to move the motor every time that you press the button. First of all we will need to keep a counter, called a variable, in which we will store the current angle of the motor. You can do that by opening the ``Variables`` menu and choosing ``Make a Variable``, name the variable ``angle``.

Now you can add the rest of the code to change the angle of the motor.

What happens when the angle reaches 180Â°? Try it out.
