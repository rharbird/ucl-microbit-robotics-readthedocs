Moving motors

-----------------
Set up the motors
-----------------
Click on the ``ServoBoard`` menu so that you can see the blocks.

Now drag out the blocks that will set up the motors and place them in the ``on start`` jaws so that your code looks like this:

Make the motors move
--------------------
Now we will add some code to move the motor every time that you press the button. First of all we will need to keep a counter, called a variable, in which we will store the current angle of the motor. You can do that by opening the ``Variables`` menu and choosing ``Make a Variable``, name the variable ``angle``.

Now you can add the rest of the code to change the angle of the motor when the button is pressed.

What happens when the angle reaches 180Â°? Try it out.

If we are going to make the robot crawl we need to make the motor move independently with no button press. To do this, move the code that makes the motor move to the ``forever`` block, like the picture. Try the code on your robot:
