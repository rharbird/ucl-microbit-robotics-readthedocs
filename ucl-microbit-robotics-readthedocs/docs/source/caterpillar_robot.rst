We’re going to build a crawling robot that’s inspired by a snake or a caterpillar but how does a crawling animal move? Take a look at these YouTube clips:

You can see from the videos that a wave passes along the caterpillar so we’ll try to make our robot mimic that.

For this project, the robot we are going to build will only have 3 body segments, we’re going to need some power to move each segment and we will use a motor, called a servo motor to do this. We'll control the motors using a program written on a micro:bit. In the next section, we'll find out about motors.
